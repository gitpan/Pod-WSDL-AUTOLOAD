SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;
      our @ISA = qw/Pod::WSDL::AUTOLOAD/;

      sub new {
        my $pgk = shift;
        bless {
              _bar => 'blah',
        }, $pgk
      }

      package main;
      use Foo;
  
      my $foo = new Foo();
      print $foo->bar;  # prints 'blah'
  
      $foo->bar('bloerch');  # sets _bar to 'bloerch'
  
DESCRIPTION
    This module is used internally by Pod::WSDL. It is unlikely that you
    have to interact directly with it. The Pod::WSDL::AUTOLOADER is used as
    a base class and handels autoloading of accessor methods. If there is a
    property called _foo in a hash based blessed reference, it will allow
    the use of the method 'foo' as a getter and setter. As a getter is
    returns the value of _foo, as a setter it sets _foo with the argument
    and returns the object. You can exclude the accessor by using a hash
    %FORBIDDEN_METHODS in the derived class like that:

      our %FORBIDDEN_METHODS = (
            foo => {get => 1, set => 0},
            bar => {get => 0, set => 0}
      );

    In this example it will not be allowed to set _foo and to set or get
    _bar. If the user of the object tries to do so, it croaks. From within
    the objects package every accessor is allowed.
